========== Tips ==========
- Hate deleting the "DISABLED_RemapBackup_" .ini/.txt files yourself after running this script? (cuz I know I do!) Run this script again (on CMD) using the --deleteBackup option
- Want the mod to only show on the remapped character and not the original character? Run this script again (on CMD) using the --hideOriginal options

For more info on command options, run this script (on CMD) using the --help option
